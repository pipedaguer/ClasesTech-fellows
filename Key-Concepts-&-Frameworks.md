This is a repository of key concepts and frameworks that we are introducing throughout the fellowship.

# Interdependence

## Relational Awareness
You are always situated in a relational context-- with yourself, with others, with groups, and with the world. We not only need to keep these contexts in mind, but also that we need to develop the skills to navigate our relationship with these entities.

## Nested complexity
We also must keep in mind that code is a very small and limited set of concerns within the wider context of the world. In order to be a great engineer and technical leader, you must constantly work to expand your awareness to include the architecture and externalities on other digital systems, the input and externalities of living systems (people, earth, etc.), which leads to the consideration of the world.
