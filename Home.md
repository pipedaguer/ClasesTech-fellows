## Support

We have three primary teams who will be actively supporting your journey through Slack, office hours, and facilitation.

### Psychosocial

Our resident space holder is Debora Rebecchi. She will be offering at least 5 hours of psychosocial therapeutic support through office hours every week. You can schedule with her here at her Calendly link.

Please note it is REQUIRED that you schedule an intake session with her before February 26th. But on an ongoing basis, we encourage you to use this support system often.

### Engineers in Residence [EIR]

Every week we will offer ~10 total office hours for synchronous technical support. Please refer to the handbook for guidelines about how and when to use this space. These office hours are not necessarily individual-- whoever shows up at at a given time will be attended to by the EIR in a group setting.

Please note it is REQUIRED that you attend at least 1 hour of office hours before February 26th. 

The available hours are on the fellowship [Google Calendar link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19lNjMxNzc2MzJmYTdlNzAwNzI2ZTEyZjllNmU1YWY3MTRkMTIyMTc5MWNlYzk0MGRiYjdhZDJiYmQ2OGYxOTI4QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) in the GREEN color.

### Community Managers [CM]

Your community managers will be present and organizing on Slack! They will play the following roles:
* Pablo Velasquez & Felipe Costa will be monitoring the #technical channel for questions with a ~24 hr response turnaround time. They will also review and give feedback on some of your assignments!
* Melissa Simplício will be moderating most other channels include #general, #random, and more. She will also be checking in with the home groups to see how the dynamics and learning is progressing

# Syllabus

## Methodology
The *ver+ tech fellowship* is based on several learning theories-- socratic methods, project based learning (PBL), inquiry based learning, and in particular, an integration of self-awareness, mindset, and skills development.

We will take advantage of various learning spaces each week:
* A synchronous ~2 hour seminar with the entire cohort + staff. These will be conducted on Zoom (link above) and usually start at 8am COL.
* Assigned _home groups_ comprised of 4 fellows each. Home groups will receive their own occasional engineering deliverables and relational practice assignments
* Individual assignments and practice. These will largely consist of coding practice on platforms like HackerRank, larger deployment projects, worksheets, and assigned reading/content
* Office hours with engineers, and psychosocial support
* English tutoring with __

Below, we will update the syllabus on a rolling basis. The following will be provided here:
* Assignments, reading, and expectations for next week uploaded on the day of the seminar
* Open-sourced summary of each seminar 1 week after the session has taken place
* Updates to our content library (feel free to suggest helpful articles and resources as you come across them!)
