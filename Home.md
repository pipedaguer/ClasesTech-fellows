## Methodology
The *ver+ tech fellowship* is based on several learning theories-- socratic methods, project based learning (PBL), inquiry based learning, and in particular, an integration of self-awareness, mindset, and skills development.

We will take advantage of various learning spaces each week:
* A synchronous ~2 hour seminar with the entire cohort + staff. These will be conducted on Zoom.
* Assigned _home groups_ comprised of 4 fellows each. Home groups will receive their own occasional engineering deliverables and relational practice assignments
* Individual assignments and practice. These will largely consist of coding practice on platforms like HackerRank, larger deployment projects, worksheets, and assigned reading/content
* Office hours with engineers, and psychosocial support
* English tutoring with __

Below, we will update the syllabus on a rolling basis. The following will be provided here:
* Assignments, reading, and expectations for next week uploaded on the day of the seminar
* Open-sourced summary of each seminar 1 week after the session has taken place
* Updates to our content library (feel free to suggest helpful articles and resources as you come across them!)
