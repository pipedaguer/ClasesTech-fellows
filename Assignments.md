# Week 1 - Assignments (All Individual)

The goal of this week is twofold:
1. to start your preparation for the industrial unified test at the end of the month which requires reinforcement of common fullstack technologies. This week, we will focus on Typescript and SQL.
2. to start developing your understanding of... why you're here!

## Cultivating Meaning [~1 hour]

We can't wait to get to know each of you!!! And part of that process is understanding where you come from, and why you're here. 

Please [fill out this Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pqqxh04VzLErUanOyYBTCU_aj7od_OTKc1j1uS4DZUw/copy?urp=gmail_link) (it will ask you to make a copy, and PLEASE put your _name_ in the name of the document). 

*Submission*: Before the end of Friday, February 16th, please SHARE the document using the sharing settings with Debora, Maribel, and Karn. Their emails are in their Slack profiles!

## Technical

We understand that many of you will already have knowledge in these assignment areas-- if so, great! The way assignments are structured is that you have to _reach_ a certain level of knowledge within these platforms. If you already know, for example, Typescript or SQL, you will simply move faster. That being said, practice is always useful ðŸ˜‰ 

This week we will focus on Typescript, a typed flavor of Javascript used by several of our hiring companies, and SQL, the foundational database language used by virtually all technological development as well. In particular, we are assigning SQLAlchemy work because it is the most popular ORM used by the industry with Python backends.

*Submission*: When you reach the end of these sections (Typescript tutorial, Typescript practice, SQLAlchemy tutorial) please take a screenshot that indicates you have reached the milestone and put it in the #technical channel in Slack! Please @mention Pablo Velasquez and Karen Sun. If you would like to upload screenshots as you go, feel free to do so but please upload any other screenshots with progress _in the same thread_ as the first screenshot you upload. 

### Typescript [~5 hours]

We are providing two tutorials for you to work through (yes, please do each one even if it's repetitive!). The goal is to reach the *TS Classes* module in the first one and to use the second platform to complete the _easy_ practices.

1. Tutorial: Here is a [W3C's](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php) quick tutorial to TypeScript with some exercises in it. Make sure to go until the TS Classes.
2. Practice: We'll use [Exercism TypeScript track](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises) as platform to practice. For this week, try to solve all [TypeScript](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises) _easy_. _(Note: After you finish the first exercise, it'll unlock the others)_

## SQL

For this section, please brush up on SQL if you are not very familiar with it in the recap section. The requirement is for you to complete the SQLAlchemy tutorial in the bottom section.

# Unified Test

You will be taking a unified coding test (~ 1 hour) the 1st week of March as a form of maintaining your place in the program! What we can share right now is that this test will cover the following:
* Typescript
* Python
* SQL
* API interfaces
* ORM concepts
