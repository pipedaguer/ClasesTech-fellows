## Git
Yes we are allll using Git all the time! However, do you _really_ know how to use Git well? In industry, you will be using Git on large teams which means understanding version control a bit more in depth past just the typical `clone`, `pull`, `push`, and `merge`. Resolving conflicts, creating patches, looking through logs... these are all thing we hope you will eventually get comfortable with!

# Week 1 - Assignments (All Individual)

The goal of this week is twofold:
1. to start your preparation for the industrial unified test at the end of the month which requires reinforcement of common fullstack technologies. This week, we will focus on Typescript and SQL.
2. to start developing your understanding of... why you're here!

## Cultivating Meaning [~1 hour]

We can't wait to get to know each of you!!! And part of that process is understanding where you come from, and why you're here. 

Please [fill out this Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pqqxh04VzLErUanOyYBTCU_aj7od_OTKc1j1uS4DZUw/copy?urp=gmail_link) (it will ask you to make a copy, and PLEASE put your _name_ in the name of the document). 

*Submission*: Before the end of Friday, February 16th, please SHARE the document using the sharing settings with Debora, Maribel, and Karn. Their emails are in their Slack profiles!

## Technical

We understand that many of you will already have knowledge in these assignment areas-- if so, great! The way assignments are structured is that you have to _reach_ a certain level of knowledge within these platforms. If you already know, for example, Typescript or SQL, you will simply move faster. That being said, practice is always useful üòâ 

This week we will focus on Typescript, a typed flavor of Javascript used by several of our hiring companies, and SQL, the foundational database language used by virtually all technological development as well. In particular, we are assigning SQLAlchemy work because it is the most popular ORM used by the industry with Python backends.

*Submission*: When you reach the end of these sections (Typescript tutorial, Typescript practice, SQLAlchemy tutorial) please take a screenshot that indicates you have reached the milestone and put it in the #technical channel in Slack! Please @mention Pablo Velasquez and Karen Sun. If you would like to upload screenshots as you go, feel free to do so but please upload any other screenshots with progress _in the same thread_ as the first screenshot you upload. 

### Typescript [~5 hours]

We are providing two tutorials for you to work through (yes, please do each one even if it's repetitive!). The goal is to reach the *TS Classes* module in the first one and to use the second platform to complete the _easy_ practices.

1. Tutorial: Here is a [W3C's](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php) quick tutorial to TypeScript with some exercises in it. Make sure to go until the TS Classes.
2. Practice: We'll use [Exercism TypeScript track](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises) as platform to practice. For this week, try to solve all [TypeScript](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises) _easy_. _(Note: After you finish the first exercise, it'll unlock the others)_

### Resources:
* [Official TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Codecademy: TypeScript Courses](https://www.codecademy.com/search?query=typescript)
* [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play)

* [Traversy Media's TypeScript Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCg4U1FzODs&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) - (YouTube Tutorial)

## SQL

For this section, please brush up on SQL if you are not very familiar with it in the recap section. The requirement is for you to complete the SQLAlchemy tutorial in the bottom section.

### SQL recap
* [Tutorial with practices](https://sqlbolt.com/)
* [SQLzoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)
* [W3C's SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)

### ORM - SQLAlchemy [~5 hours]
* [Tutorial with examples](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/sqlalchemy-tutorial-examples)

# Unified Test

You will be taking a unified coding test (~ 1 hour) the 1st week of March as a form of maintaining your place in the program! What we can share right now is that this test will cover the following:
* Typescript
* Python
* SQL
* API interfaces
* ORM concepts

# Cloud Computing Guidelines

For some of the assignments, you will be required to deploy your application to AWS, the most popular cloud computing platform.
* We have created sub organizations in our official VelezReyes+ AWS account that correspond to each of the home groups
* Each home group will receive a login to their organizational account in their email. Here, you can access the console, create API keys, and provision services
* If you run into any technical problems, please contact Felipe Costa on Slack.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è  Usage Guidelines ‚ö†Ô∏è 
*This part is critical*

Because your applications are being created for educational purposes with minimal expected traffic/load, we expect you to NOT spend more than $50USD / mo for your projects. In fact, most of your projects can be deployed for the amount of time required for feedback for even less. We have created an alert for each home group at the $50USD threshold-- please do not exceed this.

Part of engineering in the real world is managing your infrastructure costs... deploying code is not free! Additionally, this will be great input for making your architectural choices. We encourage you to use the free tier whenever possible, and look for the smallest possible deployment. 

Of course, this rule will not _always_ hold, and there are things even we don't foresee! Please stay in communication with us if you expect your spend to go over the limit.
